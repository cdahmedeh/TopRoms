## Welcome to TopRoms

The TopRoms Collection is a curated collection of classic console games focusing on high-quality, notable and popular titles. Contrary to other sets, TopRoms does not aim to be an exhaustive package with every game ever released. Instead, games are hand-picked based on their gameplay quality, historical significance and popularity to find both notable releases and obscure gems.

TopRoms covers a large set of game consoles, handhelds, arcade machines and computers all the way up to the 6th generation. The set had a modest start in 2017 with just a few older systems but has grown massively to cover so much more of gaming history.

My main motive with TopRoms was to provide a more portable package for retro ROMs and one that was more convenient. One of the main issues was hunting for games through a massive list of thousands of entries and that a random pick would likely lead into mediocrity.

## Frontends

- [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com) - My favourite frontend for desktop PC. Great for handling large collections. Comes with the excellent BigBox big-picture mode. However, quite difficult to set up with a steep learning curve.
- [RetroBat](https://www.retrobat.org) - Wonderful for a living room media-centre setup. Incredibly powerful, various tweaks at your fingertips and beautiful EmulationStation interface. Surprisingly intuitive to set up and pulls metadata and images automatically.
- [Daijishō](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Daijishou) - An Android front-end for your emulation needs. Probably the most beautiful interface I've seen in a launcher. Great for taking your collection with you on-the-go.
- [ES-DE](https://es-de.org) - A multi-platform front-end for Windows, macOS, Linux and even Android. With a decently easy-to-use scraping.
- [HyperSpin](https://hyperspin-fe.com) - Arguably the most dynamic and visually pleasing interfaces popular with those building their own arcade machines. Incredibly difficult to setup and very steep learning curve.
- [Batocera.linux](https://batocera.org) - An operating system with a front-end designed for portable devices, mainly dedicated emulator handhelds like Anbernic.
- [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com) - Integrates with Steam so that your collection shows up there. Automatically downloads and sets up emulators with basic scraping. Works great on the Steam Deck running SteamOS.

## Resources

- [Emulation General Wiki](emulation.gametechwiki.com/) - A great place to find information about emulators, compatibility and recommendations.
- [Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me) - Finding ROMs was difficult in the past with sketchy websites, slow downloads and malware. A non-profit project that hosts the majority of ROM project collections like No-Intro and Redump.
- [Pleasure Dome](https://pleasuredome.github.io/pleasuredome/) - What started a private tracker for the latest and greatest in ROM sets, especially arcade. Has become a little corner on GitHub with exhaustive packages of MAME and non-MAME sets.
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) - A gold-mine of posterity and legacy, not only for ROMs, but classic games of past eras. Books lost to time, movies and so much more. And the Wayback Machine for useful resources that have been dropped from hosting.
- [Video Game History Foundation](https://gamehistory.org) - A tiny non-profit who really care about persevering history and somehow saving lost-media. My favourite efforts was discovering and dumping the games for the defunct Sega Channel and Brenda Ross’ portfolio with art from dropped levels of Sonic 2.
- [Libretro and RetroArch](https://www.libretro.com) - I still remember the last 90s and early 2000s when emulators were all over the place, with feature sets and setup issues unique to each package. Libretro and the associated Libretro became unifying platform for almost all available emulators. Open-source and runs on pretty much any platform you can imagine. Interface is a bit complicated due to the plethora of features and tweaks but pairs excellently with various front-ends.
- [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org) - The grand-father of vintage, emulation and game preservation. Absolutely obsessed with accuracy at any cost with excellent documentation. With pretty much every system imaginable emulated. A front-end is not optional with MAME.
