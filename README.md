## Welcome to TopRoms

The TopRoms Collection is a curated collection of classic console games focusing on high-quality, notable and popular titles. Contrary to other sets, TopRoms does not aim to be an exhaustive package with every game ever released. Instead, games are hand-picked based on their gameplay quality, historical significance and popularity to find both notable releases and obscure gems.

TopRoms covers a large set of game consoles, handhelds, arcade machines and computers all the way up to the 6th generation. The set had a modest start in 2017 with just a few older systems but has grown massively to cover so much more of gaming history.

My main motive with TopRoms was to provide a more portable package for retro ROMs and one that was more convenient. One of the main issues was hunting for games through a massive list of thousands of entries and that a random pick would likely lead into mediocrity.
